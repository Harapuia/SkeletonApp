Towel Stuff
===========

Towel Stuff provides such and such and so and so. You might find
it most useful for tasks involving <x> and also <y>. Typical usage
often looks like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import towel_stuff.towel_location as ts_loc
    import towel_stuff.towel_utils    as ts_utils

    if not ts_utils.has_towel():
        print "Your towel is located:", ts_loc.where_is_my_towel()

(Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.

A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
